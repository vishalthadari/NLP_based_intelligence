# NLP_based_intelligence

## IDEA :
Today people are very busy they take shortcuts and want to get results in lesser time. So we thought of reducing the time taken by a human being in going through a book, be it a student's class book or a novel. We want to create an NLP backed Deep Learning Model which can answer all your queries after going through the book (for students, except numericals). It can perform much better than searching queries in Google as the results would be made available from the data presented by you, also as you know how the intention of question changes from person to person. For eg, bank means river bank in a certain context and it also means a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public. Thus we came up with this unique idea. 
        
## FEATURES :
1. ML model will be able to read and understand the book completely and it will provide an answer from the book itself thus saving you lots of time.
2. It can answer questions on most popular books/ holi-books/novels /comics with much accuracy and score.
3. It can summarize text for input data (fed in the form of pdf/txt/doc) page-wise/chapter-wise/whole-book.
4. The performance will be better than searching queries on Google as it would be domain specific.
5. Handwritten notes can also be fed in the form of pdf (which comes under Computer Vision part) which will be much beneficial for students in getting quick responses for their questions, especially during exam preparations.
This is what we have in our mind right now furthermore features will be implemented as we proceed.

## APPROACH:
We would be a creating a Web App(Django based) for the above NLP based Deep Learning Model which will be deployed on Heroku and the algorithms used for this project will be decided and planned on the go as there is always a scope of improvement in this area. Further the preprocessing will be done using pandas, numpy, and gensim. The model will be backed by tensorflow , using keras on top, usage of modified LDA will be there.
